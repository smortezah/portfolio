# Introduction

:zap: This website contains a collection of **data science** and **machine learning** projects that I have worked on. Each project is implemented using Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The projects cover a wide range of topics including, but not limited to, data cleaning, data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

:link: By sharing these projects, I hope to contribute to the data science community and inspire others to learn and explore this exciting field.

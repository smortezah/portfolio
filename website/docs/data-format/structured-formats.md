### CSV Unveiled

CSV files are delightfully straightforward and easy to understand. They consist of rows and columns, just like a spreadsheet, with each row representing a record and each column representing a field. Each field is separated by a comma (hence the name “Comma-Separated Values”), but other delimiters like tabs or semicolons can also be used.

Picture CSV files as treasure troves of data, where each line holds a precious gem of information. These files can store vast datasets in a compact, human-readable form, making them a favorite among data adventurers. CSVs are so popular that even the mightiest of data tools, like Excel and pandas, bow before their simplicity and versatility!

### CSV Handling with Python

Now, it’s time to wield your Python wand and start working with CSV files. Fear not, for Python offers powerful spells in the form of built-in modules to handle CSVs effortlessly.

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
import csv

# Writing to a CSV file
data = [
    ["Name", "Age", "Occupation"],
    ["Gandalf", "2019", "Wizard"],
    ["Frodo", "33", "Ring Bearer"],
]

with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as csv_file:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
    csv_writer.writerows(data)

# Reading a CSV file
with open("data.csv", "r") as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
```

```
['Name', 'Age', 'Occupation']
['Gandalf', '2019', 'Wizard']
['Frodo', '33', 'Ring Bearer']
```

### CSV Magic Tips

:::tip Dealing with Headers
Headers can be magical blessings when they accompany your CSV files. They provide context and names to the columns, making your data quests much more enjoyable. When reading CSV files, you can access the headers separately using the `csv.DictReader` or `csv.reader` class.

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
import csv

# Print the header of a CSV file
# Method 1
with open("data.csv", "r") as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
    header = csv_reader.fieldnames
    print(header)

# Method 2
with open("data.csv", "r") as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    header = next(csv_reader)
    print(header)
```

```
['Name', 'Age', 'Occupation']
```

:::tip Encoding & Decoding Potions
Python can conjure JSON from dictionaries and lists (encoding) and reverse the spell to create Python objects from JSON (decoding).

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
import json

data = {"name": "Gandalf", "age": 2019, "occupation": "Wizard"}

# Encoding Python data to JSON
json_str = json.dumps(data)
print(json_str)

# Decoding JSON to Python data
decoded_data = json.loads(json_str)
print(decoded_data)
```

```
{"name": "Gandalf", "age": 2019, "occupation": "Wizard"}

## SQL

The legendary language of databases and a crucial tool in every data sorcerer’s arsenal. SQL is like the secret language of ancient scrolls, granting you the power to interact with databases and conjure data like a master enchanter. In this section, we’ll unveil the magical wonders of SQL and how Python can serve as your faithful companion in harnessing its sorcery.

### SQL Unveiled

SQL is a declarative language designed for managing, querying, and manipulating relational databases. Think of SQL as a magical chant that enables you to communicate with powerful entities known as database management systems (DBMS). With SQL, you can create, modify, and retrieve data from databases, allowing you to uncover hidden treasures of information.

### SQL Handling with Python

To embark on your SQL adventures, Python offers a magical ally in the form of the `sqlite3` library. Together, they’ll help you cast SQL spells on a lightweight database known as SQLite.

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
import sqlite3

# Connect to a database (implicitly creates it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect("my_database.db")

# Create a table
create_table_query = """
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wizards (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    occupation TEXT
);
"""
conn.execute(create_table_query)

# Insert data into the table
insert_data_query = """
INSERT INTO wizards (name, age, occupation)
VALUES ('Gandalf', 2019, 'Wizard'),
       ('Frodo', 33, 'Ring Bearer'),
       ('Hermione', 13, 'Witch');
"""
conn.execute(insert_data_query)

# Query the database and fetch data
select_data_query = "SELECT * FROM wizards;"
cursor = conn.execute(select_data_query)
data = cursor.fetchall()
for row in data:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

```
(1, 'Gandalf', 2019, 'Wizard')
(2, 'Frodo', 33, 'Ring Bearer')
(3, 'Hermione', 13, 'Witch')
```

### SQL Magic Tips

:::tip Readability and Simplicity
SQL’s power lies in its simplicity and readability. Its human-readable syntax allows you to express complex data operations in just a few lines of code.
:::

:::tip Parameterized Queries for Security
When crafting SQL spells, be mindful of SQL injection attacks. Always use parameterized queries to shield yourself from malicious entities attempting to tamper with your data.

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
# Dangerous (don't use!):
name = "Gandalf'; DROP TABLE wizards;--"
evil_query = f"SELECT * FROM wizards WHERE name = '{name}';"

# Safe (use parameterized queries!):
safe_query = "SELECT * FROM wizards WHERE name = ?;"
cursor.execute(safe_query, (name,))
```

In this example, if the `name` value comes from user input and is not properly validated, an attacker can manipulate it to execute a dangerous command like dropping the entire `wizards` table, causing data loss. With parameterized queries, you separate the SQL code from the user-provided input. Instead of directly embedding the input into the query string, you use placeholders (often denoted by `?`) in the query. Then, you pass the actual input values separately.

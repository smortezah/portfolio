Let\u2019s take a quick trip down memory lane. Not too long ago, Keras had the ability to run on multiple backends like Theano, TensorFlow, CNTK, and even MXNet. However, in 2018, they decided to focus exclusively on TensorFlow as other backends discontinued development. But times have changed! Fast forward to 2023, and we see TensorFlow dominating the production ML space with a market share of 55% to 60%. On the other hand, PyTorch has captured the ML research realm with a market share of 40% to 45%. Meanwhile, JAX, although with a smaller market share, has gained recognition from leading players in generative AI. It\u2019s clear that each framework has its strengths and user base.

With parameterized queries, you separate the SQL code from the user-provided input. Instead of directly embedding the input into the query string, you use placeholders (often denoted by ",(0,i.jsx)(a.code,{children:"?"}),") in the query. Then, you pass the actual input values separately."]})]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.h3,{id:"additional-resources-4",children:"Additional Resources"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.p,{children:"To delve deeper into the art of SQL and explore its full potential, consult these resources:"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(a.ul,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.li,{children:(0,i.jsx)(a.a,{href:"https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html",children:"SQLite Documentation"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.li,{children:(0,i.jsx)(a.a,{href:"https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/",children:"SQLAlchemy Documentation"})}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.p,{children:"Happy data wrangling and may the Pythonic force be with you! \u2728"})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:a}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return a?(0,i.jsx)(a,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},28453:(e,a,n)=>{n.d(a,{R:()=>o,x:()=>s});var t=n(96540);const i={},r=t.createContext(i);function o(e){const a=t.useContext(r);return t.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(a):{...a,...e}},[a,e])}function s(e){let a;return a=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:o(e.components),t.createElement(r.Provider,{value:a},e.children)}}}]);

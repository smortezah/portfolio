These overlapping circles have become synonymous with illustrating set relationships, making complex data more accessible at a glance. Yet, while Venn diagrams are undeniably valuable, they also have a propensity to mislead. As a data scientist, I\u2019ve encountered their allure and their limitations. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into why Venn diagrams, despite their apparent simplicity, can be misleading if not used with caution. We\u2019ll explore the intricacies that lie beneath those overlapping circles, shedding light on when and how to employ them effectively, and when to turn to alternative visualization methods for a more accurate representation of data.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"eda/index":{"id":"eda/index","title":"Exploratory Data Analysis","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"eda/polars":{"id":"eda/polars","title":"Polars","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"Introduction","description":"This website contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects that I have worked on.
